Summary: Why have another blog?

I already have [a blog](http://www.svarchiteuthis.com) so why have another? That other blog was set up so that friends and family could follow our progress across the pacific as we sailed to New Zealand. This blog is intended for a completely different audience. If you followed the other blog and liked it, there's no reason to suspect that you'll like this one. In fact there's every reason to suspect you'll find this boring and/or incomprehensible.

This blog is intended as a combination of research notebook, collaboration outreach, and public service (for a rather narrow audience). I'm working on my PhD at the University of Auckland's Leigh Marine Laboratory but I have a background in programming. My current work is focused on creating open source software tools for remote sensing, data analysis, and quantitative accuracy assessment. I do a bit of field work (and have done heaps more in the past) but, generally speaking, I'm up to my elbows in Python code for GIS and statistics while my colleagues here at the lab are up to their elbows in fish guts and other more traditional aspects of marine biology. As I fight with my data, subject it to painful statistical analysis, and learn how to use new tools, I hope to document my progress with this blog. I'll be able to refer back to when I've forgotten how I did something. Other people who're trying to do something similar could benefit (as I have from many similarly nerdy blogs) and, if I'm lucky, this blog may help me make contact with others working on similar tasks.

So I apologize in advance to my friends and family who might see what I post here. You're probably not going to like it much. If, on the other hand, you're one of the rare individuals who finds this sort of thing interesting and/or useful please feel free to contact me. I would find it gratifying to know that someone's been helped and I'd love to collaborate on some projects.
