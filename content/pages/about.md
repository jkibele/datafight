Title: About

I'm a PhD Candidate at University of Auckland's Leigh Marine Lab. I'm a GIS / remote sensing / ecology nerd surrounded mainly by pure ecology nerds. I'm building open source software tools for benthic habitat mapping and I don't have anyone on hand to talk to about writing Python code and fighting with massive multispectral image data sets. I'm looking to connect with others who write code to battle it out with spatial data, rasters, and statistical methods.
